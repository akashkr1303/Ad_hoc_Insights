# Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Insights

## Project Overview
This project, "Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Insights," was undertaken to address the challenges faced by Atliq Hardware (a fictitious company), a leading computer hardware producer in India with a significant presence in international markets. The company's management sought to leverage data analytics to make informed decisions but lacked the necessary insights and analytics support. The project's primary objective was to provide actionable insights by performing ad-hoc analysis using MySQL.

## Problem Statement
Atliq Hardware sells its products through multiple channels, including e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, retail giants like Walmart, and its direct stores. Despite a broad market presence, the company struggled with making data-informed decisions due to a lack of comprehensive analytics. The challenge was to analyze sales data across different channels and regions and provide vital insights to the management team.

## Objectives
1. **Deliver Quick, Actionable Data Insights:** Provide the management with real-time, actionable insights to facilitate quick decision-making.
2. **Support Strategic Planning:** Offer solution to 10 ad-hoc analysis requests to aid in strategic business planning and market positioning.

## Project Phases

### 1. Data Import and Cleaning
- **Tools Used:** MySQL Workbench
- **Activities:** Imported raw sales data from various sources, including databases and CSV files. Cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Purpose:** To uncover underlying patterns and trends in the data.
- **Activities:** Conducted an in-depth exploration of sales data, including:
  - Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales sold quantity, revenue, and discounts.
  - Analyzing sales distribution across different channels and regions.

### 3. SQL Query Development
- **Purpose:** To perform specific analyses and generate insights.
- **Activities:** Developed a series of SQL queries to:
  - Calculate sales performance metrics by channel and region.
  - Analyze product division performance.
  - Identify top-selling products and underperforming segments.
  - Determine the effectiveness of various sales channels.

## Key Insights and Findings
- Significant variance in sales performance across different channels, with e-commerce platforms outperforming physical stores in certain regions.
- Identification of top-selling product categories and potential areas for product line expansion.
- Insights into regional sales trends, helping the management to tailor marketing strategies and inventory planning.

## Impact and Value
This project provided Atliq Hardware's management with crucial insights that enabled data-driven decision-making. The analysis supported strategic initiatives, optimized inventory management, and improved marketing strategies. The ability to perform ad-hoc analysis allowed for rapid response to market changes and emerging trends.

## Future Enhancements
- **Automation:** Automating data import and cleaning processes to enhance efficiency.
- **Visualization:** Developing interactive dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau for real-time data visualization.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Implementing machine learning models to predict future sales trends and customer behavior.

## How to Use This Repository
- **Data:** The dataset used in this project is not publicly available due to confidentiality agreements. However, a sample dataset with similar structure and fields can be used to replicate the analyses.
- **SQL Scripts:** The repository contains SQL scripts used for data cleaning, EDA, and generating insights.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation is provided for each phase of the project.

## Conclusion
The "Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Insights" project highlights the importance of data analytics in modern business decision-making. By leveraging MySQL for comprehensive data analysis, we provided Atliq Hardware with valuable insights that significantly impacted their strategic planning and operational efficiency.
